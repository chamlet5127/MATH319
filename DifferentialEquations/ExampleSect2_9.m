% This is an example script that will plot a curve of f(v) for particular
% values of g,k, and m. I chose an 'easy' equilibrium point so that I could
% show an example with a nice clean zero, but you can change g,k,and m and
% plot other curves.

% Also in this script I have given demos of how to do various things with
% plots so that you can make nice clean plots for the class (and in other
% classes or projects). 

% This code reproduces the plot of an example in Polking's ODE book,
% section 2.9 (Autonomous equations)

clear all                                    % This clears all variables defined in your MatLAB session

% The next two lines will set the default size for your tick marks on your

% Defining your parameters and variables

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Define your physical parameters

g = 10;            % gravitational constant
k = 10;            % drag coefficient
m = 100;            % mass of the object

v = -20:0.1:20;     % When plotting f(v),   
                    %v is the independent variable, so we define a region of values for v

foo = @(v) -g-k.*v.*abs(v)./m;  % This is an example of an inline function
% <functionname> = @(inputvariable) <define function>

% In this case you could also just do something like 

% RHS = -g-k.*v.*abs(v)./m;   

% And get the same thing. You might try commenting out line 58 and
% uncommenting line 53 and see you get the same graph. 

RHS=foo(v);

% Often the key to a good plot is making it look nice, so you have to do a

figure(1)     % You can just us plot and Matlab will open a new figure window, but you can also specify

% The command below plots a big red dot with a thin black border at the point
% where my equilibrium point is
plot(-sqrt(m*g/k),0,'o','MarkerSize',10,'MarkerEdgeColor','k','MarkerFaceColor','r')

% Label the v and f(v) axes with an even bigger font (and bold) than the
% default
ylabel('f(v)','FontSize',20,'FontWeight','bold')  
xlabel('v','FontSize',20,'FontWeight','bold')

%Give the plot (an even bigger) title
title('Equilibrium Point','FontSize',24)

% The code below will put text where my equilibrium point is. 
x1 = -sqrt(m*g/k);          %  horizontal coordinate
y1 = 0;                     %  vertical coordinate
str2 = ['(',num2str(x1),',',num2str(y1),') Equilibrium Point'] % The label
text(x1,y1+0.4,str2) % This tells matlab where to start printing and then what to print
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Note that much of matlab defines plots with builtin objects that say 'x' and 'y'
% something. So it's pretty common to see code using x,y variables and
% commands even if YOUR variables and functions are something like v or t
% or q or whatever. So be careful of that until you get used to it.

% This will first read in the size of your screen into "screen_size" as
% pixel number values
screen_size = get(0, 'ScreenSize');

% and then you can set the size of your graph.
set(1, 'Position', [0 0 0.75*screen_size(3) 0.75*screen_size(4) ] );
% the syntax is set(<figure number>,'Position', [ startx starty endx endy]);
% So in my case the code will set my figure 1 to start at the bottom left
% edge of my screen and size its width and height to be 75% of my screen's
% width and 75% of my screen's height.
